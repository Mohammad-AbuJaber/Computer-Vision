# Computer Vision Course - ENCS5343

This repository contains the implementations and documentation for the projects assigned in the **COMPUTER VISION__ENCS5343** course. Each project addresses specific aspects of computer vision, ranging from image processing to deep learning techniques. The projects are organized as follows:

## Assignment 1: Image Processing and Transformations

### Background
Assignment 1 focuses on fundamental image processing tasks, including power law transformation, noise addition, filtering, and edge detection. The goal is to enhance your understanding of basic image manipulation techniques and their effects on different types of images.

### Implementation
- Project Structure: Organize your code and output images into folders for each question (Q1, Q2, etc.) within the "Project1" directory.
- How to Run: Provide instructions on how to run the code for each question, including any dependencies or libraries required.

### Report
Include a comprehensive report with details on the implemented algorithms, input-output images, and a discussion of the obtained results. Compress the entire "Project1" folder and submit it as instructed in the course guidelines.

## Assignment 2: Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System

### Background
Assignment 2 focuses on the development of a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system. It involves designing and implementing a system architecture for image retrieval using color features. The tasks include experimenting with color histograms, color moments, and exploring advanced techniques for improved retrieval accuracy.

### Implementation
- Project Structure: Organize your code and results into folders for each task (Task1, Task2, etc.) within the "Project2" directory.
- How to Run: Clearly outline the steps to run the CBIR system, specifying any dependencies or data sources.

### Report
Compose a detailed report summarizing the system architecture, experimentation results, and insights gained from the comparison of different color features. Follow the submission guidelines for compressing and naming the submission folder.

## Course project: Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR) Using CNNs

### Background
Course project introduces the challenges and techniques of Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The tasks include building a custom CNN, exploring advanced techniques, and comparing different CNN architectures for AHCR.

### Implementation
- Project Structure: Organize your code and results into folders for each task (Task1, Task2, etc.) within the "Project3" directory.
- How to Run: Clearly outline the steps to run the code, specifying any dependencies or data sources.

### Report
Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the architectural choices, hyperparameter tuning, and experimentation results for each task. Compare and analyze the performance across different tasks, and adhere to the submission guidelines.

## General Instructions

- **Submission:** Follow the provided submission guidelines for compressing and naming the submission folders for each project.
- **Dependencies:** Clearly specify any external libraries or frameworks required to run the code.
- **Documentation:** Ensure that your code includes sufficient comments and documentation for easy understanding.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.
