# Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System

## Background

In the realm of computer vision, an image retrieval system serves as a sophisticated technology that retrieves pertinent images from a repository based on user queries. This technology comes in two primary forms: text-based and content-based. The former relies on keywords or tags to index and search for images, while the latter scrutinizes the intrinsic content of an image, seeking resemblances with other images. The content-based approach entails the extraction of various features from images, including color, texture, and shape, subsequently indexing them for efficient retrieval. Techniques such as color histograms, edge detection, and deep learning are employed to scrutinize and compare images. Users input an image, and the system responds by furnishing images with akin visual content. Image retrieval systems find applications in diverse fields such as stock photography, e-commerce, medical imaging, law enforcement, and personal use.

## Objectives

### Overall Objective
Develop a functional CBIR system using different color features and evaluate its performance.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Implementation of CBIR System:**
   - Develop a CBIR system incorporating color histogram and color moment features.
2. **Feature Extraction Experimentation:**
   - Experiment with color histogram and color moment effectiveness for image content representation.
3. **Evaluate the CBIR System:**
   - Define evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1 score), conduct experiments on a benchmark dataset, and analyze the effectiveness of different color features.
4. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Prepare a detailed report summarizing system development, experimentation results, and insights gained from the comparison of color features.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Build the CBIR System
Design and implement a system architecture for image retrieval using color features. Develop functionalities for loading images, extracting features, computing distances, and ranking results.

### Task 2: Implement the CBIR System using Color Histogram
Experiment with 120 pins, 180 pins, and 360 pins. Use Euclidean distance measure and compute precision, recall, F1 score, and time. Construct an ROC curve and calculate the AUC. Average results over at least 10 queries.

### Task 3: Experiment with Color Moments
3.1: Implement CBIR using Color Moments (mean, standard deviation, and skewness) as image representation. Use Euclidean distance measure with equal weights.
3.2: Repeat 3.1 with different weights for moments.
3.3: Expand on 3.2 by adding more moments (Median, Mode, Kurtosis).

### Task 4: Improve CBIR System Performance
Experiment with other image representation techniques.
